Welcome to Sessions ("the App"), the pocket songwriting gizmo! This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you use our application.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using the Sessions app, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect several different types of information for various purposes to provide and improve our Service to you.

**a. Information You Provide Directly:**

*   **Account Information:** When you create an account, we collect your email address, a username (if you choose to provide one or if it's part of the sign-up process), and your password. This information is used for authentication and account management.
*   **User-Generated Content:** This includes any content you create or input into the app, such as:
    *   Lyrics, song ideas, notes, and project-related text.
    *   Audio recordings made within the app.
    *   Inputs provided to our AI-powered tools (e.g., words for the Story Generator, lyrics for the Lyric Remix, phrases for the Metaphor Maker, themes for the Theme Expander, words for the Connector, lyrics for the Song Analyser, and text for the Quotes tool).
    *   Outputs generated by these AI tools that you choose to save or associate with your projects.
*   **Subscription Information:** If you subscribe to Pro features, our payment processor (RevenueCat) will handle your payment information. We may receive transaction confirmation data from RevenueCat, but we do not directly store your full payment card details.
*   **Communications:** If you contact us for support or other inquiries (e.g., via dan@keepmeyoung.uk), we will collect the information you provide in your communication.

**b. Information Collected Automatically:**

This Usage Data may include information such as your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g., IP address), device model, operating system version, the features of our Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those features, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data. This is primarily handled through Firebase's default analytics capabilities.
*   **Device Information:** We may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model and operating system version) via standard mobile application platform capabilities and services like `device_info_plus` and `package_info_plus` to help us provide support and improve the app.
*   **Local Preferences:** App preferences, such as your selected theme, are stored locally on your device using `shared_preferences`.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

Sessions uses the collected data for various purposes:

*   **To Provide and Maintain Our Service:** Including account creation, authentication, saving your projects and content, and enabling the functionality of all tools.
*   **To Process Subscriptions:** To manage Pro subscriptions through our third-party payment processor, RevenueCat.
*   **To Power AI Features:** Your inputs to AI tools are sent to a third-party AI service (DeepSeek API) to generate results.
*   **To Improve Our Service:** To understand how users interact with the app, identify areas for improvement, fix bugs, and develop new features. Firebase Analytics helps us with this.
*   **For Customer Support:** To respond to your inquiries and provide assistance.
*   **To Ensure Security:** To monitor for and prevent fraudulent or unauthorized activity.

These providers are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

    *   When you use these tools, the text or prompts you provide are sent to DeepSeek for processing to generate the AI output.

    *   DeepSeek states that information they collect may be stored on servers located in the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China.
    *   We encourage you to review DeepSeek's Privacy Policy for full details.

*   **RevenueCat:** We use RevenueCat to manage in-app purchases and subscriptions for our Pro features. RevenueCat handles payment processing and subscription status.
    *   RevenueCat's use of your information is governed by their Privacy Policy: [https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy)

*   **Legal Requirements:** We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect and defend our rights or property, prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service, protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public, or protect against legal liability.

## 4. Data Storage and Security

The security of your data is important to us. We rely on the security measures provided by our third-party services like Firebase (Google Cloud Platform) for data storage, which include industry-standard encryption for data at rest and in transit.

While we and our service providers strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.

## 5. Data Retention

We will retain your Personal Information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.

*   **Account Information & User-Generated Content:** We will retain your account information and associated user-generated content stored in Firebase for as long as your account is active. If your account becomes inactive, we will retain this data for a period of **5 years** from the last date of activity, after which it may be deleted.
*   **Data Processed by AI Services:** Inputs sent to the DeepSeek API may be retained by DeepSeek according to their data retention policies for service improvement and model training. Please refer to DeepSeek's Privacy Policy for details.

## 6. Your Rights and Choices

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information. These may include the right to:

*   Access, update, or delete the information we have on you (primarily through your account settings or by contacting us).
*   Object to processing of your personal information.
*   Request that we restrict the processing of your personal information.
*   Data portability.
*   Withdraw consent (where we rely on consent for processing).

If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us at dan@keepmeyoung.uk.
Users can typically manage their Firebase account and associated data. For data processed by DeepSeek, you would need to refer to their policy and contact them directly.

You can manage your subscription through the platform you used to subscribe (e.g., Apple App Store or Google Play Store).

## 7. Children's Privacy

The Sessions app is intended for users who are **14 years of age and older**.

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 14. Our use of third-party services like DeepSeek also aligns with this, as their services state they are not aimed at children under 14. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child under 14 has provided us with Personal Information without your consent, please contact us at dan@keepmeyoung.uk. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Information from children under 14 without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers and services.

If you are between 14 and 18 (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction), you should review this policy with your parent or guardian to make sure you both understand it.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the app and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.

You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page. Your continued use of the Service after we post any modifications to the Privacy Policy on this page will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.
